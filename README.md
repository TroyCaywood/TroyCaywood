# Who am I?

Hi! I'm an IT professional with over 15 years of experience in the industry. I've done a little bit of everything. From infrastructure management, to scripting and automation.

## What is this git for?

This contains scripts and other projects that I have written. Hopefully some of them will be helpful to you.

- I'm currently working my way through the 100 Days of Python Code [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code) course and keeping [notes](https://github.com/TroyCaywood/Python/tree/main/100%20Days%20of%20Code#readme) on my github.
